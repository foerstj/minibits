# ds2-shrooms

![pic](pic.png)

Mushrooms from DS2, without glow effects.
- Cave mushrooms standing upright & growing out of walls
  - added the unused variants (standing 04, wall 05)
  - added the unused group models (10 groups of DS1 mushrooms + 2 groups of DS2 cave mushrooms)
- Enchanted Forest mushrooms
- Special mushrooms of Voldane & Amren, including animated lever
- added the unused global cluster model (yet another bunch of Fly Agaric)

Unfortunately, the DS2 implementation of the glow effects is not compatible with DS1 (component & effect scripts).
