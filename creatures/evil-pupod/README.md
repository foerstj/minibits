Templates for the cut-content Pupod enemy, whose animations and spell can be found in the original resources.
- Enemies (pupod 01 & 02) for beginner levels, using original spell
- Enemies balanced for Dark Swamp
- Ambient actors (can die, neutral alignment, not present in multiplayer)
- Veteran & Elite versions

This folder also includes a minimod build, which replaces the non-interactive Pupods with the enemy Pupods balanced for Dark Swamp (Regular).
