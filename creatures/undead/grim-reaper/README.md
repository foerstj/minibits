1. A hooded skeleton with a scythe, it's the grim reaper!\
This model is original cut content, I merely had to define a template for it.

2. The Grim Reaper endboss from Utraean Peninsula: Zombie Apocalypse\
This is an endboss at Gom level, with several custom attack spells, custom heal spell, and custom summon spell. Uses skeleton animations, which more-or-less fit the model.

Includes veteran & elite templates.
