# npc-fg-talk

Like base_npc_fg but it doesn't auto-talk in chore_fidget.\
(Which is actually quite sexist imho...)\
Instead, animations are more in line with base_npc_fb which has a 'talk' entry in chore_misc.\
This enables fg npcs to simply stand around, and play the 'talk' anim during conversation. Which also works together nicely with job_talk_npc.skrit in generic-talk-skrits btw.\
(Also added qffg and chore_magic to be more in line with base_npc_fb.)
