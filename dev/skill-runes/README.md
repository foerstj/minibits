# skill-runes

Based on the skill award scrolls in Return to Arhok, I made these runes for balance testing my part of the Collab 2024 project (The Goblin Menace).

- Instead of experience value, you have to specify the uber level.\
  This works better with characters that are not completely new.
- Includes runes for Veteran & Elite, and a container.\
  Containers are one of the object types that get replaced when generating Veteran & Elite.

Requires LoA.
