# darker-night-fog

Makes the fog darker during the night, in line with the daylight brightness.

Originally, the fog brightness varies between 50% and 125% of the value defined in the mood. This mod computes the fog color & brightness based on the daylight instead, which goes down to zero in the middle of the night.
- On the Utraean Peninsula, during the final stage of the main quest, fog brightness is reversed. This mod inverts the daylight instead, which achieves a similar result.
- Fog brightness is also decreased during heavy rain. This mod also makes the fog color a bit grayer then, and makes it grayer and brighter during heavy snowfall.
- Based on mood-managers-refactored, which introduces some minor changes for minor edge cases.

Works with Vanilla and LoA.
