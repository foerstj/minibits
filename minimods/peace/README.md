# peace

A minimod that makes evil creatures neutral, and defuses enemy generators.

This overwrites the alignments in the actor_evil and actor_custom core templates. Actors with explicit alignment, and actors that get their alignment set dynamically, are not covered.

This overwrites the generator_advanced_a2 and the generator_auto_object_exploding components, which are most commonly used to generate enemies. Not all enemy generators might be covered, and some non-enemies might be affected as well.

For LoA.
