# no-resurrect

A minimod that removes resurrection spells & shrines from the resources.

This adds permadeath to singleplayer mode. In multiplayer, players can of course still respawn as ghost or enter a new game.

There's a variant for Vanilla and one for LoA. Choose the one you need. Don't have both active.
