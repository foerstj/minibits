# dev-timeofday-midnight

This makes the day-night-cycle always be at its darkest point at midnight.

Affects fog brightness everywhere (it's at 50% at night). Affects sunlight everywhere except where there are custom definitions (i.e. snow areas).

Note: this mod is called midnight and sets sunlight to zero around the clock, however acktchually originally the sunlight is only zero at 3am.

Works with Vanilla and LoA. Not compatible with dev-Dayspeed (but that wouldn't make sense anyway).
