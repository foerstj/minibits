# unlimited-summons

An improved version of the original UnlimitedSummons by MercuryPenguin.

Improvements:
- Based on LoA skrit - improves unsummoning in multiplayer (tho obviously not relevant here), and fading of SFX-only creatures (Zepheryl)
- Not overriding spell_return_summoned - was unnecessary
