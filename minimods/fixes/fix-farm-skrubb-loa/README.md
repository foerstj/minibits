# fix-farm-skrubb-loa

![pic](pic.jpg)

Fixes the texture of the Farm Skrubb that was presumably inadvertently overwritten by LoA.

The Farm Skrubb keeps the bluish texture "03", while the Jungle Skrubb now uses the brownish texture under the new name "03-loa". Fixed including Veteran & Elite Jungle Skrubbs.
