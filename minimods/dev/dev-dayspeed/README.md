# dev-dayspeed

Normal speed for the day-night-cycle in DS is 38.4 real minutes. This mod makes the cycle go 24x as fast, taking only 1.6 real minutes.
Useful for debugging stitch lighting, and for photoshooting.

Build folder also includes a variant that only speeds up the cycle by 6x, taking 6.4 real minutes. Made it for some of my Youtube videos.
