# fix-hrt-galaxy

![pic](pic.jpg)

Fixes the galaxy texture of the Hi-Res Texture (Esrgan) mod. The texture in HRT is more hi-res, but unfortunately also intransparent. This issue was not noticed because the galaxy template is not used in the original maps. If you have a map that uses it, and want to play with HRT mod, you can add this as a fix.

Note that the name of the dsres needs to come before the HRT dsres alphabetically. Recommended name is DS_HRT_a_galaxy_fix.dsres.
