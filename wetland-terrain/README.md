# wetland-terrain

Terrain nodes for making a wetland - basically swamp nodes but with jungle texture.

Result is much brighter & friendlier than the poisonous original swamps.

Same doors & internal coordinates as the original swamp nodes. This way they can simply be swapped out, for turning a swamp region into a wetland region.

Note: The swamp-wall nodes don't play along nicely, because with transparent water, a gap in the terrain can be seen.\
My solution was to use a combination of forest-wall nodes, water nodes, and blocking objects.
