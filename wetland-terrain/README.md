# wetland-terrain

Terrain nodes for making a wetland - basically swamp nodes but with jungle texture.

Result is much brighter & friendlier than the poisonous original swamps.

Same doors & internal coordinates as the original swamp nodes. This way they can simply be swapped out, for turning a swamp region into a wetland region.
