Pumpkin resources from the "Halloween Special Late Late Show" map.
- Pumpkin helmet: original unique progressive item, and a simple pcontent-available variant.
- Mr. Pumpkin Head: figure wearing the pumpkin helmet, also including his special rags and reaper scythe.\
  The special components (haste_manager & hs_cheater_scanner) were removed.
- A simple non-interactive pumpkin for decoration, and a lantern variant with the flicker component.

This folder also includes a build, so you can continue to use the pumpkin helmet without HS LLS or Halloween mod.

Note: the pumpkin model/texture was made for LoA, and for some reason the texture misaligns in Vanilla.\
To remedy this, use the Pumpkin-vanilla-fix.dsres. Do not use it with LoA.
