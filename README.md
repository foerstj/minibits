# minibits
A handy collection of Dungeon Siege Bits for easy re-use.

## The rules
- Each minibits resource contains a README.md and a Bits folder.
- The README.md explains what the resource is, where/whom it comes from, and how it's licensed (default is CC-BY-SA).
- The Bits folder contains the resource files in the structure required for dsres. Using the resource for your project should be as simple as copy-pasting into your main Bits folder.
